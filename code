# After accessing the datasets on the open data websites for each city Baltimore and Oakland,
# I filtered the data to keep only the 311 calls logged after March 1, 2020 at 12:00 AM.
# I initially tried to do this manually but the datasets were too large and kept crashing R Studio.

library(dplyr)
# data import for Baltimore dataset
baltimore <- read.csv("311baltimore.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
head(baltimore, 10)

# data import for Oakland dataset
oakland <- read.csv("311oakland.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
head(oakland, 10)

# print column names for baltimore
names(baltimore)

# retain relevant variables for baltimore dataset
keeps <- c("SRType", "CreatedDate", "Address")
baltimore <- baltimore[keeps]

# replace street address with "Baltimore"
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
# str_split(as.character(baltimore$Address), ',')
baltimore <- baltimore %>% mutate("Address" = replace("Baltimore", "Address" == " ", NA))

#change column names of baltimore dataset
colnames(baltimore) <- c("description", "call_date", "city")
View(baltimore)

# print column names for oakland
names(oakland)

# retain relevant variables for oakland dataset
keeps <- c("DATETIMEINIT", "DESCRIPTION", "City")
oakland <- oakland[keeps]

#change column names of oakland dataset
colnames(oakland) <- c("call_date", "description", "city")
View(oakland)

# vertical merge of baltimore and oakland datasets
baltimoreoakland <- bind_rows(baltimore, oakland)
View(baltimoreoakland)
